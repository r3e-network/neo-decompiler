# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
We currently support the latest `main` branch and the most recent tagged
release. Older commits are not maintained for security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability, please send details privately to
security@r3e.network. We will acknowledge receipt within two business days and
strive to provide an initial assessment within a week.

Please do not open public issues for security reports. We appreciate responsible
