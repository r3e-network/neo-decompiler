🧠 HIVE MIND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

You are the Queen coordinator of a Hive Mind swarm with collective intelligence capabilities.

HIVE MIND CONFIGURATION:
📌 Swarm ID: swarm-1755881587858-21t2695a4
📌 Swarm Name: hive-1755881587850
🎯 Objective: Below is an end‑to‑end, production‑grade plan to build a Neo N3 decompiler that inputs a NEF file (+ optional debug info) and a manifest, and outputs a high‑level, auditable programming representation with complete coverage of Neo N3 opcodes, NEPs, syscalls, native contracts, and all standard execution constructs.

Goals and non‑goals
- Goals
  - Fully decode any valid N3 NEF into a rich, typed IR and high‑level pseudocode suitable for security audits.
  - Support all N3 opcodes, control flow (including exceptions), alt stack, static fields, method tokens (CALLT), dynamic calls (CALLA), native contract interop, and syscalls.
  - Leverage manifest ABI, permissions, events, and optionally on‑chain data to improve type info and naming.
  - Provide analyzers for NEP-17, NEP-11, and other relevant NEPs to annotate and validate conformance.
  - Provide a CLI, library API, and extensible plugin system for new syscalls/NEPs and custom analyses.
- Non‑goals
  - Reconstruct original source with perfect fidelity. We target semantically equivalent, audit‑friendly pseudocode, not original formatting/variable names.

High‑level architecture
- Frontends (inputs)
  - NEF parser: header (NEF3 magic, compiler, version), checksum, tokens (method tokens table), script bytecode.
  - Manifest parser: JSON schema for name, ABI (methods, parameters, return types), events, permissions, trusts, groups, features.
  - Optional: Debug symbols (.nefdbgnfo) if available for method names, sequence points, local var names.
  - Optional: Network context (MainNet/TestNet magic) for native contract script hashes mapping, and RPC endpoint to fetch external manifests by script hash.
- Core
  - Disassembler: Bytecode → instruction list with precise offsets, operand decoding (short/long forms), branch targets, exception regions.
  - Lifter: NeoVM stack machine → typed SSA‑based IR with explicit variables, effects, storage, and interop calls.
  - Decompiler: IR → structured high‑level pseudocode (“Neo Audit Language”, NAL) or optional C#‑like backend.
  - Analyses: CFG, dominators, stack abstract interpretation, type inference, constant propagation/folding, copy/const cleanup, dead code elimination, alias/modeling for storage, effect‑system propagation, exception structuring, loop/if structuring, pattern recognition (NEPs).
- Backends (outputs)
  - Typed SSA IR dump (for deep audits).
  - High‑level NAL pseudocode with explicit types/effects.
  - Reports: syscall/native coverage, event mappings, storage schema, potential vulnerabilities and suspicious patterns.

Detailed implementation plan

Phase 0 — Spec capture and baseline data
- Catalog Neo N3 instruction set, encodings, and semantics from the official spec.
  - Arithmetic/logic, stack/alt‑stack ops, control flow (JMP/JMPIF/JMPIFNOT, CALL/CALL_L/CALLA/CALLT, SWITCH if present), exceptions (TRY/TRY_L/ENDTRY/ENDFINALLY/THROW), return/abort.
  - Locals/args/static ﬁelds slots: INITSLOT, INITSSLOT, LDARG/LDLOC/STSFLD/LDSFLD, short forms.
  - Data/collection ops: NEWARRAY/NEWSTRUCT/PACK/UNPACK, MAP/STRUCT/ARRAY ops, ByteString/Buffer ops, CONVERT.
- Build authoritative syscall database with IDs, names, signatures, calling conventions, and side effects:
  - System.* (Runtime, Storage, Crypto, Iterator/Enumerator, Contract, ContractManagement, Ledger, Oracle, Policy, StdLib, RoleManagement, GAS/NEO, etc.).
  - Native contract method surfaces and standard script hashes per network, with the ability to override or fetch via RPC.
- NEP knowledge base
  - NEP‑17 (FT), NEP‑11 (NFT), NEP‑11-N (Non-divisible variant), common auxiliary NEPs used in practice.
  - Patterns, required methods and events, storage key conventions (heuristics), permission expectations.

Phase 1 — Loaders and validators
- NEF loader
  - Validate magic/version/checksum.
  - Parse tokens table (CALLT): list of method tokens mapping indices to target contract hashes and method names/signatures (if present).
  - Extract script bytes and compiler metadata.
- Manifest loader
  - Validate against JSON schema.
  - ABI: map method names → parameter types/names, return types; events; permissions; groups; features.
  - Build cross‑refs from ABI to code entry points (offset mapping via debug info if present; otherwise heuristic mapping from public methods by discovery).
- Optional debug info loader (.nefdbgnfo)
  - Method symbols, local variable names, sequence points for source mapping (if available).
- Environment
  - Network magic, native hashes, and optional RPC for fetching external contract manifests (for external calls and CALLT resolution if only hash is available).

Phase 2 — Disassembler
- Decode sequentially to instructions with:
  - Offset, opcode, operand(s), immediate values, target addresses for control flow.
  - Normalize short/long variants to a unified representation.
- Identify basic blocks
  - Split at jump targets, fallthroughs, exception handler entries (TRY ranges), method boundaries (if known).
  - Build control‑flow graph (CFG) including exceptional edges (catch/finally).
- Extract method boundaries
  - From manifest method entries + optional debug info + INITSLOT patterns + RET/ABORT analysis.
  - If multiple methods share code region (common in compilers), use callgraph/entrypoint analysis.

Phase 3 — Lifting to IR
- Stack machine to register form
  - Abstract interpret evaluation stack and alt stack; assign virtual registers to each stack value in SSA form.
  - Model multiple stacks: evaluation, alt, and return stack semantics where applicable.
  - Explicit memory/effect modeling for storage, contract state (static slots), and interop handles (Iterator/Enumerator).
- Types and values
  - Neo types: Any/Null, Boolean, Integer (arbitrary precision), ByteString, Buffer, Array, Map, Struct, InteropInterface, Pointer.
  - Type lattice with union/refinements and conversions (CONVERT op).
  - Seed types from:
    - Manifest ABI method signatures.
    - Syscall/native method signatures.
    - Literal shapes and opcode semantics.
  - Propagate: forward dataflow + backward constraints from consumers; widen conservatively for unknown paths.
- Side effects and resources
  - Annotate each IR op with effect categories: Storage(R/W), Runtime(ReadOnly), Crypto, Calls(Contract), Native, Iterator, Oracle, Ledger, Policy, Gas.
  - Track gas costs if possible (optional feature; requires per‑opcode and per‑syscall gas schedule).
- Calls
  - Direct calls (CALL/CALL_L) within script → method nodes.
  - CALLA (dynamic address) → indirect call nodes with target set refined by constant propagation.
  - CALLT (method tokens) → resolve using tokens table and attach target contract hash and method name/signature; if external, bind to external manifest (RPC) for richer types.
  - Contract.Call syscalls → rewrite to typed external invocations when method/flags/name constants are discoverable.
- Static fields and globals
  - Model static slots as global variables; name them via debug info if available; otherwise g0, g1, …
- Exception modeling
  - Build exceptional CFG regions for TRY/ENDTRY/ENDFINALLY/THROW.
  - Lift to IR try/catch/finally constructs with explicit handler variables.

Phase 4 — Decompilation to high‑level structures
- Structuring
  - Region‑based structuring for if/else, loops (while/for), switch (if present), and try/catch/finally.
  - Handle irreducible CFG via gotos only as last resort with audit‑friendly annotations.
- Variables and naming
  - Use ABI param names, event param names, and debug locals where available.
  - Heuristics:
    - Storage keys used consistently become field‑like properties.
    - Iterator/Enumerator variables named iterX/emX based on syscall context.
    - External contract references named from manifest names or known native aliases.
- High‑level API rewriting
  - Rewrite syscalls to high‑level function calls with explicit types and effects.
  - Storage operations:
    - System.Storage.* to Storage.get/put/delete with typed keys; infer key prefixes and shape based on constant strings and NEP patterns.
  - Iterators/enumerators:
    - Iterator.Next/Value loops to foreach patterns.
  - Runtime/auth:
    - Runtime.CheckWitness → require/auth guards.
  - Events:
    - Runtime.Notify or native event emissions mapped to manifest event names with typed args.
- Output language
  - Neo Audit Language (NAL) design:
    - Strongly typed, expression‑first syntax; no implicit conversions outside CONVERT.
    - Explicit effect annotations per function and call site (e.g., effects(StorageR|StorageW|Native(Policy)|ContractCall), mayThrow).
    - First‑class primitives for Storage, Runtime, Crypto, Iterators.
    - BigInt as default integer; ByteString defaults to immutable bytes; Buffer mutable.
    - Contract hash literals and CallFlags as typed enums.
    - Try/catch/finally and using‑style constructs for interop handles if needed.
  - Optional: C#‑like backend for devpack familiarity, gated behind a “conservative lowering” to avoid unsound sugar.

Phase 5 — NEP and standards support
- NEP recognizers:
  - NEP‑17:
    - Methods balanceOf, transfer, decimals, symbol, totalSupply; event Transfer; storage patterns for balances/allowances (if any); permission expectations.
  - NEP‑11:
    - OwnerOf, BalanceOf, Transfer, properties; event Transfer; token data storage pattern.
  - Report conformance status and deviations, annotate decompiled code with NEP roles.
- Native contracts integration
  - Bind native calls to typed stubs: Ledger, Oracle, Policy, RoleManagement, ContractManagement, CryptoLib, StdLib, NEO, GAS.
  - Network‑aware script hash resolution and aliasing (e.g., Hash160(NEO) → native Neo contract).

Phase 6 — Security analysis and audit reports
- Dataflow and guard analysis
  - Require‑pattern detection for authorization (CheckWitness, role checks).
  - Parameter validation: null/empty checks, range checks, length checks before storage writes and external calls.
- Contract call safety
  - Analyze Contract.Call targets, CallFlags, and reentrancy potential across external calls; flag non‑deterministic or unsafe patterns.
- Storage schema and integrity
  - Infer storage keyspace schema and prefixing; identify collisions or unscoped keys.
  - Detect unbounded iteration or quadratic patterns over storage.
- Arithmetic and asset flows
  - Overflow/underflow not native with BigInteger, but flag conversion truncations (e.g., ByteString to Integer), negative allowance, and unchecked subtractions in transfer logic.
- Exception and abort paths
  - Identify THROW/ABORT conditions, unreachable code, and inconsistent state writes before abort.
- Gas hotspots
  - Estimate worst‑case gas per method; highlight loops over storage/iterators and expensive syscalls.
- Reports
  - Summaries: entrypoints, effects matrix, syscall/native coverage, external dependencies, events mapping, permissions vs actual use.
  - Findings with severities and code anchors in decompiled output.

Phase 7 — Tooling and UX
- CLI
  - disasm: pretty disassembly with offsets and operands.
  - cfg: emit graphviz of CFG and exception regions.
  - decompile: produce NAL and/or C#‑like pseudocode, plus IR dump.
  - analyze: run security analyzers and NEP conformance checks; output SARIF/JSON and human‑readable reports.
  - fetch: resolve external manifests via RPC and cache them.
- Library API
  - Programmatic access to loaders, IR, passes, decompilation, and analysis; plugin hooks for:
    - New syscalls/native mappings.
    - Custom type domains and analyzers.
    - Output backends.
- IDE integrations
  - LSP server for NAL with jump‑to IR/opcode, cross refs, and inlay effect/type hints.

Correctness and completeness strategy
- Validation against reference contracts
  - Neo‑project devpack examples (C#), official test contracts, and popular community contracts (NEP‑17/11).
  - Cross‑check by re‑assembling from IR/pseudocode to bytecode (where feasible) or differential execution via embedded NeoVM and test vectors.
- Execution equivalence harness
  - Embed NeoVM interpreter to run original NEF vs decompiled IR interpreter on random/fuzzed inputs to ensure semantic alignment for each method.
- Opcode coverage
  - Unit tests per opcode semantics, including edge cases in stack depth, alt stack, and exception behavior.
- Exception and CALLA edge cases
  - Tests for nested try/finally, multiple catch regions, CALLA with partially known targets, and fallback heuristics.

Data models and key components (concise)
- IR nodes (indicative)
  - Const, Var, Phi
  - Unary/Binary ops (typed; BigInt, ByteString)
  - Convert(type)
  - Call(FuncRef, args, callflags?, targetHash?, effects)
  - Syscall(SysRef, args, effects)
  - Storage(op: Get/Put/Delete, ctx, key, val?)
  - Iterator(New/Next/Value/Key/Dispose)
  - Control: If, Switch, Loop, Break/Continue, Try/Catch/Finally, Throw, Return
- Type system
  - Neo base types + Tuple/Struct shapes + Map<K,V> with shape inference; Union(T?) for nullable; Function types for delegates.
- Effect system
  - Bitset or tagged set: StorageR, StorageW, ContractCall, Native(ContractName), Runtime, Crypto, Iterator, Oracle, Ledger, Policy, MayThrow.

Performance and scalability
- Linear disassembly; graph construction O(n).
- Lifting with single‑pass abstract interpretation, then SSA and sparse conditional propagation.
- Structuring via region algorithms; worst‑case n log n on complex CFGs.
- Caches for external manifests and native metadata.

Extensibility
- Syscall/native registry is data‑driven (JSON or codegen); add/override without core changes.
- NEP recognizers as plugins with pattern libraries.
- Output backends pluggable; NAL guaranteed stable schema for downstream tools.

Deliverables and milestones
- M1: NEF/manifest parsers, disassembler, opcode tests, CFG.
- M2: Lifter to SSA IR with stack/alt stack support, basic type inference, direct calls, syscalls modeled.
- M3: Structuring (if/loops), basic high‑level pseudocode, event mapping, storage ops rewriting.
- M4: CALLT/CALLA resolution, exception structuring, iterator rewriting, native contract bindings.
- M5: NEP‑17/11 recognizers, security analyzers (auth, storage schema, external calls), reports.
- M6: CLI, library API, docs, sample decompilations, and test corpus; optional C# backend.
- M7: Execution equivalence harness, fuzzing, and coverage goals; performance tuning.

Risks and mitigations
- Dynamic calls (CALLA) with unknown targets: annotate as unknown; allow user to provide hints; attempt runtime trace aid via VM.
- Missing debug info → poor names: use ABI and heuristics; allow user‑provided symbol maps.
- Irreducible CFG: fall back to structured with limited gotos and clear annotations.
- Evolving syscalls/NEPs: data‑driven registries and versioned metadata.

What you’ll get from the decompiler
- Readable, typed pseudocode with:
  - Explicit authorization checks, storage reads/writes, native/syscall calls with effects.
  - High‑level loops and try/catch/finally.
  - Events and external calls rendered with real names and types where possible.
- A rigorous IR suitable for automated proofs and custom analysis.
- Auditing reports covering standards conformance, dependency graph, permissions vs usage, and potential vulnerability findings.

If you want, I can also scaffold a repository layout (packages, modules, registry files for syscalls and natives, IR schema, and initial opcode tables) and a minimal working CLI to start iterating on M1–M2.

  - Neo base types + Tuple/Struct shapes + Map<K,V> with shape inference; Union(T?) for nullable; Function types for delegates.
- Effect system
  - Bitset or tagged set: StorageR, StorageW, ContractCall, Native(ContractName), Runtime, Crypto, Iterator, Oracle, Ledger, Policy, MayThrow.

Performance and scalability
- Linear disassembly; graph construction O(n).
- Lifting with single‑pass abstract interpretation, then SSA and sparse conditional propagation.
- Structuring via region algorithms; worst‑case n log n on complex CFGs.
- Caches for external manifests and native metadata.

Extensibility
- Syscall/native registry is data‑driven (JSON or codegen); add/override without core changes.
- NEP recognizers as plugins with pattern libraries.
- Output backends pluggable; NAL guaranteed stable schema for downstream tools.

Deliverables and milestones
- M1: NEF/manifest parsers, disassembler, opcode tests, CFG.
- M2: Lifter to SSA IR with stack/alt stack support, basic type inference, direct calls, syscalls modeled.
- M3: Structuring (if/loops), basic high‑level pseudocode, event mapping, storage ops rewriting.
- M4: CALLT/CALLA resolution, exception structuring, iterator rewriting, native contract bindings.
- M5: NEP‑17/11 recognizers, security analyzers (auth, storage schema, external calls), reports.
- M6: CLI, library API, docs, sample decompilations, and test corpus; optional C# backend.
- M7: Execution equivalence harness, fuzzing, and coverage goals; performance tuning.

Risks and mitigations
- Dynamic calls (CALLA) with unknown targets: annotate as unknown; allow user to provide hints; attempt runtime trace aid via VM.
- Missing debug info → poor names: use ABI and heuristics; allow user‑provided symbol maps.
- Irreducible CFG: fall back to structured with limited gotos and clear annotations.
- Evolving syscalls/NEPs: data‑driven registries and versioned metadata.

What you’ll get from the decompiler
- Readable, typed pseudocode with:
  - Explicit authorization checks, storage reads/writes, native/syscall calls with effects.
  - High‑level loops and try/catch/finally.
  - Events and external calls rendered with real names and types where possible.
- A rigorous IR suitable for automated proofs and custom analysis.
- Auditing reports covering standards conformance, dependency graph, permissions vs usage, and potential vulnerability findings.

If you want, I can also scaffold a repository layout (packages, modules, registry files for syscalls and natives, IR schema, and initial opcode tables) and a minimal working CLI to start iterating on M1–M2." }

🎯 OBJECTIVE EXECUTION STRATEGY:

For the objective: "Below is an end‑to‑end, production‑grade plan to build a Neo N3 decompiler that inputs a NEF file (+ optional debug info) and a manifest, and outputs a high‑level, auditable programming representation with complete coverage of Neo N3 opcodes, NEPs, syscalls, native contracts, and all standard execution constructs.

Goals and non‑goals
- Goals
  - Fully decode any valid N3 NEF into a rich, typed IR and high‑level pseudocode suitable for security audits.
  - Support all N3 opcodes, control flow (including exceptions), alt stack, static fields, method tokens (CALLT), dynamic calls (CALLA), native contract interop, and syscalls.
  - Leverage manifest ABI, permissions, events, and optionally on‑chain data to improve type info and naming.
  - Provide analyzers for NEP-17, NEP-11, and other relevant NEPs to annotate and validate conformance.
  - Provide a CLI, library API, and extensible plugin system for new syscalls/NEPs and custom analyses.
- Non‑goals
  - Reconstruct original source with perfect fidelity. We target semantically equivalent, audit‑friendly pseudocode, not original formatting/variable names.

High‑level architecture
- Frontends (inputs)
  - NEF parser: header (NEF3 magic, compiler, version), checksum, tokens (method tokens table), script bytecode.
  - Manifest parser: JSON schema for name, ABI (methods, parameters, return types), events, permissions, trusts, groups, features.
  - Optional: Debug symbols (.nefdbgnfo) if available for method names, sequence points, local var names.
  - Optional: Network context (MainNet/TestNet magic) for native contract script hashes mapping, and RPC endpoint to fetch external manifests by script hash.
- Core
  - Disassembler: Bytecode → instruction list with precise offsets, operand decoding (short/long forms), branch targets, exception regions.
  - Lifter: NeoVM stack machine → typed SSA‑based IR with explicit variables, effects, storage, and interop calls.
  - Decompiler: IR → structured high‑level pseudocode (“Neo Audit Language”, NAL) or optional C#‑like backend.
  - Analyses: CFG, dominators, stack abstract interpretation, type inference, constant propagation/folding, copy/const cleanup, dead code elimination, alias/modeling for storage, effect‑system propagation, exception structuring, loop/if structuring, pattern recognition (NEPs).
- Backends (outputs)
  - Typed SSA IR dump (for deep audits).
  - High‑level NAL pseudocode with explicit types/effects.
  - Reports: syscall/native coverage, event mappings, storage schema, potential vulnerabilities and suspicious patterns.

Detailed implementation plan

Phase 0 — Spec capture and baseline data
- Catalog Neo N3 instruction set, encodings, and semantics from the official spec.
  - Arithmetic/logic, stack/alt‑stack ops, control flow (JMP/JMPIF/JMPIFNOT, CALL/CALL_L/CALLA/CALLT, SWITCH if present), exceptions (TRY/TRY_L/ENDTRY/ENDFINALLY/THROW), return/abort.
  - Locals/args/static ﬁelds slots: INITSLOT, INITSSLOT, LDARG/LDLOC/STSFLD/LDSFLD, short forms.
  - Data/collection ops: NEWARRAY/NEWSTRUCT/PACK/UNPACK, MAP/STRUCT/ARRAY ops, ByteString/Buffer ops, CONVERT.
- Build authoritative syscall database with IDs, names, signatures, calling conventions, and side effects:
  - System.* (Runtime, Storage, Crypto, Iterator/Enumerator, Contract, ContractManagement, Ledger, Oracle, Policy, StdLib, RoleManagement, GAS/NEO, etc.).
  - Native contract method surfaces and standard script hashes per network, with the ability to override or fetch via RPC.
- NEP knowledge base
  - NEP‑17 (FT), NEP‑11 (NFT), NEP‑11-N (Non-divisible variant), common auxiliary NEPs used in practice.
  - Patterns, required methods and events, storage key conventions (heuristics), permission expectations.

Phase 1 — Loaders and validators
- NEF loader
  - Validate magic/version/checksum.
  - Parse tokens table (CALLT): list of method tokens mapping indices to target contract hashes and method names/signatures (if present).
  - Extract script bytes and compiler metadata.
- Manifest loader
  - Validate against JSON schema.
  - ABI: map method names → parameter types/names, return types; events; permissions; groups; features.
  - Build cross‑refs from ABI to code entry points (offset mapping via debug info if present; otherwise heuristic mapping from public methods by discovery).
- Optional debug info loader (.nefdbgnfo)
  - Method symbols, local variable names, sequence points for source mapping (if available).
- Environment
  - Network magic, native hashes, and optional RPC for fetching external contract manifests (for external calls and CALLT resolution if only hash is available).

Phase 2 — Disassembler
- Decode sequentially to instructions with:
  - Offset, opcode, operand(s), immediate values, target addresses for control flow.
  - Normalize short/long variants to a unified representation.
- Identify basic blocks
  - Split at jump targets, fallthroughs, exception handler entries (TRY ranges), method boundaries (if known).
  - Build control‑flow graph (CFG) including exceptional edges (catch/finally).
- Extract method boundaries
  - From manifest method entries + optional debug info + INITSLOT patterns + RET/ABORT analysis.
  - If multiple methods share code region (common in compilers), use callgraph/entrypoint analysis.

Phase 3 — Lifting to IR
- Stack machine to register form
  - Abstract interpret evaluation stack and alt stack; assign virtual registers to each stack value in SSA form.
  - Model multiple stacks: evaluation, alt, and return stack semantics where applicable.
  - Explicit memory/effect modeling for storage, contract state (static slots), and interop handles (Iterator/Enumerator).
- Types and values
  - Neo types: Any/Null, Boolean, Integer (arbitrary precision), ByteString, Buffer, Array, Map, Struct, InteropInterface, Pointer.
  - Type lattice with union/refinements and conversions (CONVERT op).
  - Seed types from:
    - Manifest ABI method signatures.
    - Syscall/native method signatures.
    - Literal shapes and opcode semantics.
  - Propagate: forward dataflow + backward constraints from consumers; widen conservatively for unknown paths.
- Side effects and resources
  - Annotate each IR op with effect categories: Storage(R/W), Runtime(ReadOnly), Crypto, Calls(Contract), Native, Iterator, Oracle, Ledger, Policy, Gas.
  - Track gas costs if possible (optional feature; requires per‑opcode and per‑syscall gas schedule).
- Calls
  - Direct calls (CALL/CALL_L) within script → method nodes.
  - CALLA (dynamic address) → indirect call nodes with target set refined by constant propagation.
  - CALLT (method tokens) → resolve using tokens table and attach target contract hash and method name/signature; if external, bind to external manifest (RPC) for richer types.
  - Contract.Call syscalls → rewrite to typed external invocations when method/flags/name constants are discoverable.
- Static fields and globals
  - Model static slots as global variables; name them via debug info if available; otherwise g0, g1, …
- Exception modeling
  - Build exceptional CFG regions for TRY/ENDTRY/ENDFINALLY/THROW.
  - Lift to IR try/catch/finally constructs with explicit handler variables.

Phase 4 — Decompilation to high‑level structures
- Structuring
  - Region‑based structuring for if/else, loops (while/for), switch (if present), and try/catch/finally.
  - Handle irreducible CFG via gotos only as last resort with audit‑friendly annotations.
- Variables and naming
  - Use ABI param names, event param names, and debug locals where available.
  - Heuristics:
    - Storage keys used consistently become field‑like properties.
    - Iterator/Enumerator variables named iterX/emX based on syscall context.
    - External contract references named from manifest names or known native aliases.
- High‑level API rewriting
  - Rewrite syscalls to high‑level function calls with explicit types and effects.
  - Storage operations:
    - System.Storage.* to Storage.get/put/delete with typed keys; infer key prefixes and shape based on constant strings and NEP patterns.
  - Iterators/enumerators:
    - Iterator.Next/Value loops to foreach patterns.
  - Runtime/auth:
    - Runtime.CheckWitness → require/auth guards.
  - Events:
    - Runtime.Notify or native event emissions mapped to manifest event names with typed args.
- Output language
  - Neo Audit Language (NAL) design:
    - Strongly typed, expression‑first syntax; no implicit conversions outside CONVERT.
    - Explicit effect annotations per function and call site (e.g., effects(StorageR|StorageW|Native(Policy)|ContractCall), mayThrow).
    - First‑class primitives for Storage, Runtime, Crypto, Iterators.
    - BigInt as default integer; ByteString defaults to immutable bytes; Buffer mutable.
    - Contract hash literals and CallFlags as typed enums.
    - Try/catch/finally and using‑style constructs for interop handles if needed.
  - Optional: C#‑like backend for devpack familiarity, gated behind a “conservative lowering” to avoid unsound sugar.

Phase 5 — NEP and standards support
- NEP recognizers:
  - NEP‑17:
    - Methods balanceOf, transfer, decimals, symbol, totalSupply; event Transfer; storage patterns for balances/allowances (if any); permission expectations.
  - NEP‑11:
    - OwnerOf, BalanceOf, Transfer, properties; event Transfer; token data storage pattern.
  - Report conformance status and deviations, annotate decompiled code with NEP roles.
- Native contracts integration
  - Bind native calls to typed stubs: Ledger, Oracle, Policy, RoleManagement, ContractManagement, CryptoLib, StdLib, NEO, GAS.
  - Network‑aware script hash resolution and aliasing (e.g., Hash160(NEO) → native Neo contract).

Phase 6 — Security analysis and audit reports
- Dataflow and guard analysis
  - Require‑pattern detection for authorization (CheckWitness, role checks).
  - Parameter validation: null/empty checks, range checks, length checks before storage writes and external calls.
- Contract call safety
  - Analyze Contract.Call targets, CallFlags, and reentrancy potential across external calls; flag non‑deterministic or unsafe patterns.
- Storage schema and integrity
  - Infer storage keyspace schema and prefixing; identify collisions or unscoped keys.
  - Detect unbounded iteration or quadratic patterns over storage.
- Arithmetic and asset flows
  - Overflow/underflow not native with BigInteger, but flag conversion truncations (e.g., ByteString to Integer), negative allowance, and unchecked subtractions in transfer logic.
- Exception and abort paths
  - Identify THROW/ABORT conditions, unreachable code, and inconsistent state writes before abort.
- Gas hotspots
  - Estimate worst‑case gas per method; highlight loops over storage/iterators and expensive syscalls.
- Reports
  - Summaries: entrypoints, effects matrix, syscall/native coverage, external dependencies, events mapping, permissions vs actual use.
  - Findings with severities and code anchors in decompiled output.

Phase 7 — Tooling and UX
- CLI
  - disasm: pretty disassembly with offsets and operands.
  - cfg: emit graphviz of CFG and exception regions.
  - decompile: produce NAL and/or C#‑like pseudocode, plus IR dump.
  - analyze: run security analyzers and NEP conformance checks; output SARIF/JSON and human‑readable reports.
  - fetch: resolve external manifests via RPC and cache them.
- Library API
  - Programmatic access to loaders, IR, passes, decompilation, and analysis; plugin hooks for:
    - New syscalls/native mappings.
    - Custom type domains and analyzers.
    - Output backends.
- IDE integrations
  - LSP server for NAL with jump‑to IR/opcode, cross refs, and inlay effect/type hints.

Correctness and completeness strategy
- Validation against reference contracts
  - Neo‑project devpack examples (C#), official test contracts, and popular community contracts (NEP‑17/11).
  - Cross‑check by re‑assembling from IR/pseudocode to bytecode (where feasible) or differential execution via embedded NeoVM and test vectors.
- Execution equivalence harness
  - Embed NeoVM interpreter to run original NEF vs decompiled IR interpreter on random/fuzzed inputs to ensure semantic alignment for each method.
- Opcode coverage
  - Unit tests per opcode semantics, including edge cases in stack depth, alt stack, and exception behavior.
- Exception and CALLA edge cases
  - Tests for nested try/finally, multiple catch regions, CALLA with partially known targets, and fallback heuristics.

Data models and key components (concise)
- IR nodes (indicative)
  - Const, Var, Phi
  - Unary/Binary ops (typed; BigInt, ByteString)
  - Convert(type)
  - Call(FuncRef, args, callflags?, targetHash?, effects)
  - Syscall(SysRef, args, effects)
  - Storage(op: Get/Put/Delete, ctx, key, val?)
  - Iterator(New/Next/Value/Key/Dispose)
  - Control: If, Switch, Loop, Break/Continue, Try/Catch/Finally, Throw, Return
- Type system
  - Neo base types + Tuple/Struct shapes + Map<K,V> with shape inference; Union(T?) for nullable; Function types for delegates.
- Effect system
  - Bitset or tagged set: StorageR, StorageW, ContractCall, Native(ContractName), Runtime, Crypto, Iterator, Oracle, Ledger, Policy, MayThrow.

Performance and scalability
- Linear disassembly; graph construction O(n).
- Lifting with single‑pass abstract interpretation, then SSA and sparse conditional propagation.
- Structuring via region algorithms; worst‑case n log n on complex CFGs.
- Caches for external manifests and native metadata.

Extensibility
- Syscall/native registry is data‑driven (JSON or codegen); add/override without core changes.
- NEP recognizers as plugins with pattern libraries.
- Output backends pluggable; NAL guaranteed stable schema for downstream tools.

Deliverables and milestones
- M1: NEF/manifest parsers, disassembler, opcode tests, CFG.
- M2: Lifter to SSA IR with stack/alt stack support, basic type inference, direct calls, syscalls modeled.
- M3: Structuring (if/loops), basic high‑level pseudocode, event mapping, storage ops rewriting.

1. Break down into major phases using swarm_think
2. Create specialized worker teams for each phase
3. Establish success criteria and checkpoints
4. Implement feedback loops and adaptation
5. Aggregate and synthesize all worker outputs
6. Deliver comprehensive solution with consensus

⚡ CRITICAL: CONCURRENT EXECUTION WITH CLAUDE CODE'S TASK TOOL:

The Hive Mind MUST use Claude Code's Task tool for actual agent execution:

✅ CORRECT Pattern:
[Single Message - All Agents Spawned Concurrently]:
  Task("Researcher", "Research patterns and best practices...", "researcher")
  Task("Coder", "Implement core features...", "coder")
  Task("Tester", "Create comprehensive tests...", "tester")
  Task("Analyst", "Analyze performance metrics...", "analyst")
  TodoWrite { todos: [8-10 todos ALL in ONE call] }

❌ WRONG Pattern:
Message 1: Task("agent1", ...)
Message 2: Task("agent2", ...)
Message 3: TodoWrite { single todo }
// This breaks parallel coordination!

Remember:
- Use Claude Code's Task tool to spawn ALL agents in ONE message
- MCP tools are ONLY for coordination setup, not agent execution
- Batch ALL TodoWrite operations (5-10+ todos minimum)
- Execute ALL file operations concurrently
- Store multiple memories simultaneously

🚀 BEGIN HIVE MIND EXECUTION:

Initialize the swarm now with the configuration above. Use your collective intelligence to solve the objective efficiently. The Queen must coordinate, workers must collaborate, and the hive must think as one.

Remember: You are not just coordinating agents - you are orchestrating a collective intelligence that is greater than the sum of its parts.
